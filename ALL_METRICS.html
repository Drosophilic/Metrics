<p>Access to a resource may be limited by the specified communication protocol. In particular, we are worried about access to technical specifications and any costs associated with implementing the protocol.

<p>Do an HTTP get on the URL to see if it returns a valid document. Ideally, we would have a universal database of communication protocols from which we can check this URL (this is now being created in FAIRSharing). We also check whether questions 2 and 3 are true or false.</p>

<p>Not all content can be made available without restriction. For instance, access and distribution of personal health data may be restricted by law or by organizational policy. In such cases, it is important that the protocol by which such content can be accessed is fully specified. Ideally, electronic content can be obtained first by applying for access. Once the requester is formally authorized to access the content, they may receive it in some electronic means, for instance by obtaining an download URL, or through a more sophisticated transaction mechanism (e.g. authenticate, authorize), or by any other means. The goal should be to reduce the time it takes for valid requests to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Cross-references to data from third-party’s FAIR data and metadata will naturally degrade over time, and become “stale links”. In such cases, it is important for FAIR providers to continue to provide descriptors of what the data was to assist in the continued interpretation of those third-party data. As per FAIR Principle F3, this metadata remains discoverable, even in the absence of the data, because it contains an explicit reference to the IRI of the data.</p>

<p>Whether there is a scheme to uniquely identify the digital resource.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-we-measure-it-3">Why should we measure it?</h3>
<p>The uniqueness of an identifier is a necessary condition to unambiguously refer that resource, and that resource alone. Otherwise, an identifier shared by multiple resources will confound efforts to describe that resource, or to use the identifier to retrieve it. Examples of identifier schemes include, but are not limited to URN, IRI, DOI, Handle, trustyURI, LSID, etc. For an in-depth understanding of the issues around identifiers, please see http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2001414</p>

<p>The availability of machine-readable metadata that describes a digital resource.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-we-measure-it-5">Why should we measure it?</h3>
<p>This metric <em>does not</em> attempt to measure (or even define) &quot;Richness&quot; - this will be defined in a future Metric. This metric is intended to test the format of the metadata - machine readability of metadata makes it possible to optimize discovery. For instance, Web search engines suggest the use of particular structured metadata elements to optimize search. Thus, the machine-readability aspect can help people and machines find a digital resource of interest.</p>
<h3 id="what-must-be-provided-for-the-measurement-5">What must be provided for the measurement?</h3>
<p>A URL to a document that contains machine-readable metadata for the digital resource. Furthermore, the file format must be specified.</p>

<p>HTTP GET on the metadata URL. A response of [a 200,202,203 or 206 HTTP response after resolving all and any prior redirects. e.g. 301 -&gt; 302 -&gt; 200 OK] indicates that there is indeed a document. The second URL should resolve to the record of a registered file format (e.g. DCAT, DICOM, schema.org etc.) in a registry like FAIRsharing. Future ehnancements to FAIRSharing may include tags that indicate whether or not a given file format is generally-agreed to be machine-readable </p>

<p>The discovery of digital object should be possible from its metadata. For this to happen, the metadata must explicitly contain the identifier for the digital resource it describes, and this should be present in the form of a qualified reference, indicating some manner of &quot;about&quot; relationship, to distinguish this identifier from the numerous others that will be present in the metadata.</p>
<p>In addition, since many digital objects cannot be arbitrarily extended to include references to their metadata, in many cases the only means to discover the metadata related to a digital object will be to search based on the GUID of the digital object itself.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-being-measured-10">What is being measured?</h3>
<p>Relationships within (meta)data, and between local and third-party data, have explicit and ‘useful’ semantic meaning</p>
<h3 id="why-should-we-measure-it-10">Why should we measure it?</h3>
<p>One of the reasons that HTML is not suitable for machine-readable knowledge representation is that the hyperlinks between one document and another do not explain the nature of the relationship - it is “unqualified”. For Interoperability, the relationships within and between data must be more semantically rich than “is (somehow) related to”.</p>
<p>Numerous ontologies include richer relationships that can be used for this purpose, at various levels of domain-specificity. For example, the use of skos for terminologies (e.g. exact matches), or the use of SIO for genomics (e.g. “has phenotype” for the relationship between a variant and its phenotypic consequences). The semantics of the relationship do not need to be &quot;strong&quot; - for example, &quot;objectX wasFoundInTheSameBoxAs objectY&quot; is an acceptable qualified reference</p>
<p>Similarly, dbxrefs must be predicated with a meaningful relationship what is the nature of the cross-reference?</p>
<p>Finally, data silos thwart interoperability. Thus, we should reasonably expect that some of the references/relations point outwards to other resources, owned by third-parties; this is one of the requirements for 5 star linked data. </p>

<h3 id="why-should-we-measure-it-13">Why should we measure it?</h3>
<p>Various communities have recognized that maximizing the usability of their data requires them to adopt a set of guidelines for metadata (often in the form of “minimal information about…” models). Non-compliance with these standards will often render a dataset ‘reuseless’ because critical information about its context or provenance is missing. However, adherence to community standards does more than just improve reusability of the data. The software used by the community for analysis and visualization often depends on the (meta)data having certain fields; thus, non-compliance with standards may result in the data being unreadable by its associated tools. As such, data should be (individually) certified as being compliant, likely through some automated process (e.g. submitting the data to the community’s online validation service)</p>

<h1 id="how-to-create-a-new-metric">HOW TO CREATE A NEW METRIC</h1>
<p>Metrics are created, initially, as a narrative document, <a href='http://fairmetrics.org/fairmetricform.html'>following a template<a> extablished by the FAIR Metrics Authoring Group. Guidance for how to complete this document is found in the <a href='http://fairmetrics.org/framework.html'>authoring framework overview</a>.</p>
<p>Once a Metric has been designed, the document should be submitted via 'pull request' to this repository, at which time it becomes available for community discussion. The author of the Metric should publicize their Metric as widely as possible, to encourage maximal community input.</p>
<p>At this time, there is no formal process for adoption of Metrics (incuding those that the Metrics Authoring Group have designed themselves!), as there is no official body that can recognize or &quot;stamp&quot; a Metric as being &quot;valid&quot;. Nevertheless, authors should consider the comments and criticisms they receive, and modify the Metric accordingly if the criticisms are justified.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-create-a-new-metric-test">HOW TO CREATE A NEW METRIC TEST</h1>
<p>With the goal of providing an objective, automated way of testing (meta)data resources against the Metrics, the Metrics Authorship Group have created the FAIR Evaluator, which is running as a demonstration service at <strong>CURRENTLY OFFLINE FOR REDESIGN</strong>. The Evaluator provides a registry and execution functions for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metric Tests</li>
<li>Community-defined Collections of Metric Tests</li>
<li>Quantitative FAIRness evaluations of a Resource based on these Collections.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Metric Test is a Web API that has the following features:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It is described in YAML using a <a href="http://smart-api.info/">smartAPI</a> interface annotation (smartAPI is an extension of openAPI/Swagger, which allows semantic annotation of various metadata elements and interface input/output fields. <a href="http://smart-api.info/editor/">An editor for smartAPI</a> is available.</li>
<li>HTTP GET on the endpoint of the Metric Test URL returns that smartAPI document in YAML (for example: http://linkeddata.systems/cgi-bin/FAIR_Tests/gen2_unique_identifier)</li>
<li>HTTP POST of the <strong>metadata GUID</strong> to that same endpoint, in a simple JSON document {subject =&gt; GUID}, triggers the execution of the test.<br />
</li>
<li>The Test returns a block of JSON-LD containing information about the test, including date/time, comments, and score</li>
</ol>
<p>(we are working on JSON Schema for these documents now, but following the example below will get you started)</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>curl -X POST -D -L -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -H &quot;Accept: application/json&quot; -d &#39;{&quot;subject&quot;: &quot;10.5281/zenodo.1147435&quot;}&#39; http://linkeddata.systems/cgi-bin/FAIR_Tests/gen2_unique_identifier</code></pre>
<p>Might return the following result:</p>
<pre><code>  [
    {
      &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;http://linkeddata.systems/cgi-bin/FAIR_Tests/gen2_unique_identifier#10.5281/zenodo.1147435/result-2018-12-31T13:32:43+00:00&quot;,

<p>The &quot;score&quot; of the Metric Test is the value of the &quot;SIO:000300&quot; (has_value) predicate, and must be a floating-point value between 0 and 1. The precise meaning of that value should be explained in the Comments (schema:comment) section, along wth, for example, explanations for failure. Other metadata is provided, as shown (all shown fields are required!).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> No other information may be provided to the Metric Test beyond the <strong>metadata</strong> GUID. The purpose of FAIR Metric Tests is to determine if machines can find, access, and &quot;interpret&quot; (meta)data, thus it is a firm requirement that only the metadata GUID may be given to the test. The aspect of FAIRness being evaluated <strong>must</strong> be automatically discernable using that metadata.</p>
<p>This Metric Test is registered by either HTTP POST of properly formatted JSON to the Evaluator registry (see API here:https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics/tree/master/MetricsEvaluatorCode/Ruby/fairmetrics), or by visiting the manual submission page at: <strong>CURRENTLY OFFLINE FOR A REDESIGN</strong>, where the form field on that page asks for the URL of the Metric Test's YAML document.</p>
<p>Once registered, a Metric Test can be included in new Metric Collections, and used by the Evaluator software for automated testing of data resources.</p>
<h1 id="resources-available-to-help-in-metric-testing">Resources available to help in Metric Testing</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://fairsharing.org">FAIRSharing Registry</a> is a repository for a wide variety of standards, including file formats, ontologies, identifier types, etc. They provide a JSON API that can be used within Metrics Tests to look-up &quot;standards&quot; a test encounters in its exploration of (meta)data to determine if that standard is registered. Standards that are not registered with FAIRSharing should be encouraged to do so by contacting the appropriate standards-body, or by contacting the FAIRSharing team with a request to include the standard in their registry.</p>
<h1 id="philosophy-of-fair-testing-under-development-comments-welcome">PHILOSOPHY OF FAIR TESTING (under development! Comments welcome!)</h1>
<p>Evaluating FAIRness is a controversial issue! We (the Metrics Authoring Group) feel that these concerns can be eased through bringing more clarity regarding the &quot;philosophy&quot; behind FAIRness testing.</p>
<p>First, there is no such thing as &quot;FAIR&quot;, and neither is there &quot;unFAIR&quot;! As described in <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/information-services-and-use/isu824">this manuscript</a>, we view FAIR as a continuum of 'behaviors' exhibited by a data resource that increasingly enable machine discoverability and (re)use. Moreover, the final FAIR Principle speaks directly to the fact that &quot;FAIR&quot; will have different requirements for different communities! Thus, a given Metric (and its associated Metric Test) may not be applicable to certain types of resources from a given community; or, alternatively, there may exist in that community some standard that is widely accepted within that community to enable machine-actionability of a data resource, but that would not be recognized by a &quot;generic&quot; computational agent. This is all completely acceptable, and is the reason that the Metrics and the Metric Testing framework have been established as a community-driven initiative, rather than top-down.</p>
<p>For example: In the bioinformatics community, a widely used format for Sequence Features is <a href="https://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff3.html">GFF3</a> - a tab-delimited format with specific constraints on the content of each field. From the perspective of a &quot;generic&quot; computational agent, it would be ~impossible to interpret or reuse that data; however, there are constraints on that format that speak directly to the interoperability objectives of FAIR - for example, that the &quot;type&quot; field must consist of a term from the Sequence Ontology. Thus, it would be reasonable for the Bioinformatics community to create a FAIR Metric, and its associated Metric Test, that evaluated if a GFF3 file fulfilled those requirements. Thus, a community could create a Metric Collection that eschewed the &quot;generic&quot; test for machine-readability of the data, and instead, utilized their own Metric Test that validated the content of that GFF3 file.</p>
<p>In light of this, we insist that FAIR evaluations are not intended to be used as &quot;judgement&quot;, but rather as a means to objectively (AND TRANSPARENTLY!) test if a resource has successfully fulfilled the FAIRness requirements that <strong>that community</strong> has established. In this light, FAIR Evaluation is a way for individual providers, or repository owners, to test their own compliance, and to take remedial action if their resources are not passing the tests. Confirmation and/or guidance, rather than judgement.</p>
<p>Certainly, we believe that some FAIR Metrics (for example, that the entity has a globally unique identifier, and that all data should have a license and citation information) are universal, and a prerequisite for FAIRness; however, many of the FAIR Principles must be interpreted by the individual communities, keeping as close to the &quot;spirit&quot; of FAIR as possible.</p>
