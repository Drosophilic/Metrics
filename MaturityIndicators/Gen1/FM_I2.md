### Maturity Assessment Name:  Use FAIR Vocabularies
----

### To which principle does it apply?  
I2 - (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles


### What is being measured?
The metadata values and qualified relations should themselves be FAIR, for example, terms from open, community-accepted vocabularies published in an appropriate knowledge-exchange format.



### Why should we measure it?
It is not possible to unambiguously interpret metadata represented as simple keywords or other non-qualified symbols.  For interoperability, it must be possible to identify data that can be integrated like-with-like.  This requires that the data, and the provenance descriptors of the data, should (where reasonable) use vocabularies and terminologies that are, themselves, FAIR.


### What must be provided for the measurement?
IRIs representing the vocabularies used for (meta)data 


### How is the measurement executed?
Resolve IRIs, check FAIRness of the returned document(s).


### What is/are considered valid result(s)?
Successful resolution; document is amenable to machine-parsing and identification of terms within it.  It may be possible to use FAIRSharing to validate these vocabularies.



### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
