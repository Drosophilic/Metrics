### Maturity Assessment Name: Meets Community Standards
----

### To which principle does it apply?  

R1.3 - (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards


### What is being measured?

Certification, from a recognized body, of the resource meeting community standards.

### Why should we measure it?

Various communities have recognized that maximizing the usability of their data requires them to adopt a set of guidelines for metadata (often in the form of “minimal information about…” models). Non-compliance with these standards will often render a dataset ‘reuseless’ because critical information about its context or provenance is missing. However, adherence to community standards does more than just improve reusability of the data. The software used by the community for analysis and visualization often depends on the (meta)data having certain fields; thus, non-compliance with standards may result in the data being unreadable by its associated tools. As such, data should be (individually) certified as being compliant, likely through some automated process (e.g. submitting the data to the community’s online validation service)



### What must be provided for the measurement?

A certification saying that the resource is compliant


### How is the measurement executed?


Validate the electronic signature as coming from a community authority (e.g. a verisign signature)


### What is/are considered valid result(s)?

Successful signature validation


### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
