### Maturity Assessment Identifier: FM-F4 [https://purl.org/fair-metrics/FM_F4](https://purl.org/fair-metrics/FM_F4)

### Maturity Assessment Name:  Indexed in a searchable resource
----

### To which principle does it apply?  
F4 - (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

### What is being measured?
The degree to which the digital resource can be found using web-based search engines.


### Why should we measure it?
Most people use a search engine to initiate a search for a particular digital resource of interest. If the resource or its metadata are not indexed by web search engines, then this would substantially diminish an individualâ€™s ability to find and reuse it. Thus, the ability to discover the resource should be tested using i) its identifier, ii) other text-based metadata. 


### What must be provided for the measurement?

The persistent identifier of the resource and one or more URLs that give search results of different search engines.


### How is the measurement executed?
We perform an HTTP GET on the URLs provided and attempt to to find the persistent identifier in the page that is returned. A second step might include following each of the top XX hits and examine the resulting documents for presence of the identifier. 


### What is/are considered valid result(s)?
Present or absent in the result set 


### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)


### Comments
 should set a "top 50" or something
