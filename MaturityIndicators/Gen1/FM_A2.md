### Maturity Assessment Identifier: FM-A2 [https://purl.org/fair-metrics/FM_A1.2](https://purl.org/fair-metrics/FM_A2)

### Maturity Assessment Name:  Metadata Longevity

----

### To which principle does it apply?  
A2 - metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

### What is being measured?
The existence of metadata even in the absence/removal of data


### Why should we measure it?
Cross-references to data from third-party’s FAIR data and metadata will naturally degrade over time, and become “stale links”.  In such cases, it is important for FAIR providers to continue to provide descriptors of what the data was to assist in the continued interpretation of those third-party data.  As per FAIR Principle F3, this metadata remains discoverable, even in the absence of the data, because it contains an explicit reference to the IRI of the data.


### What must be provided for the measurement?
URL to a formal metadata longevity plan


### How is the measurement executed?
Resolve the URL


### What is/are considered valid result(s)?
- Successful resolution
- Returns a document that represents a plan or policy of some kind
- Preferably certified (e.g. DSA)


### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
