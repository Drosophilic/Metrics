### Maturity Assessment Name:   Identifier Uniqueness

----

### To which principle does it apply?  
F1

### What is being measured?
Whether there is a scheme to uniquely identify the digital resource.


### Why should we measure it?
The uniqueness of an identifier is a necessary condition to unambiguously refer that resource, and that resource alone. Otherwise, an identifier shared by multiple resources will confound efforts to describe that resource, or to use the identifier to retrieve it. Examples of identifier schemes include, but are not limited to URN, IRI, DOI, Handle, trustyURI, LSID, etc. For an in-depth understanding of the issues around identifiers, please see http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2001414

### What must be provided for the measurement?
URL to a registered identifier scheme.


### How is the measurement executed?
An identifier scheme is valid if and only if it is described in a repository that can register and present such identifier schemes (e.g. fairsharing.org).
Information about the identifier scheme must be presented with a machine-readable document containing the FM1 attribute with the URL to where the scheme is described.  see specification for implementation.


### What is/are considered valid result(s)?
Present or Absent


### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
