### Maturity Assessment Identifier: FM-R1.1 [https://purl.org/fair-metrics/FM_R1.1](https://purl.org/fair-metrics/FM_R1.1)

### Maturity Assessment Name: Accessible Usage License
----

### To which principle does it apply?  
R1.1 - (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license




### What is being measured?

The existence of a license document, for BOTH (independently) the data and its associated metadata, and the ability to retrieve those documents



### Why should we measure it?

A core aspect of data reusability is the ability to determine, unambiguously and with relative ease, the conditions under which you are allowed to reuse the (meta)data.  Thus, FAIR data providers must make these terms openly available.  This applies both to data (e.g. for the purpose of third-party integration with other data) and for metadata (e.g. for the purpose of third-party indexing or other administrative metrics)


### What must be provided for the measurement?

IRI of the license (e.g. its URL) for the data license and for the metadata license


### How is the measurement executed?

Resolve the IRI(s) using its associated resolution protocol



### What is/are considered valid result(s)?

A document containing the license information


### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
