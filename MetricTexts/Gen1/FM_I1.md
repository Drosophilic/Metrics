### Maturity Assessment Identifier: FM-I1 [https://purl.org/fair-metrics/FM_I1](https://purl.org/fair-metrics/FM_I1)

### Maturity Assessment Name:  Use a Knowledge Representation Language
----

### To which principle does it apply?  
I1 - (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation

### What is being measured?
use of a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.


### Why should we measure it?

The unambiguous communication of knowledge and meaning (what symbols are, and how they relate to one another) necessitates the use of languages that are capable of representing these concepts in a machine-readable manner.  


### What must be provided for the measurement?

URL to the specification of the language


### How is the measurement executed?
- The language must have a BNF (or other specification language) \newline 
- The URL resolves (accessible) \newline 
- The document has an IANA media-type (i.e. it is sufficiently widely-accepted and shared that it has been registered) \newline 
- The language can be arbitrarily extended (e.g. PDBml can be used to represent knowledge, but only about proteins) \newline 


### What is/are considered valid result(s)?
BNF (or other?) found, Media-type of the document is registered in FAIRSharing. 



### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)


### Comments
Future: FAIRSharing has tags to indicate constrained vs. extendable languages?
