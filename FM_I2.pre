 fm:measuring "The metadata values and qualified relations should themselves be FAIR, for example, terms from open, community-accepted vocabularies published in an appropriate knowledge-exchange format."^^xsd:string ;
 fm:rationale "It is not possible to unambiguously interpret metadata represented as simple keywords or other non-qualified symbols.  For interoperability, it must be possible to identify data that can be integrated like-with-like.  This requires that the data, and the provenance descriptors of the data, should (where reasonable) use vocabularies and terminologies that are, themselves, FAIR."^^xsd:string ;
 fm:requirements "IRIs representing the vocabularies used for (meta)data "^^xsd:string ;
 fm:procedure "Resolve IRIs, check FAIRness of the returned document(s)."^^xsd:string ;
 fm:validation "Successful resolution; document is amenable to machine-parsing and identification of terms within it.  It may be possible to use FAIRSharing to validate these vocabularies."^^xsd:string ;
 fm:relevance "All"^^xsd:string ;
 fm:examples "None"^^xsd:string ;
 fm:comments "michel: there must be a syntax and associated semantics for that language.  This is sufficient \n  mark: there needs to be some identity or denotation in the language; ('vanilla') xml and json are not FAIR, so should fail this test\n  \n  *** can you (i) identify elements and (ii) make statements about them, and iii) is there a formally defined interpretation for that   -> HTML fails; PDF fails \n  shared\n  -> that there are many users of the language\n  . acknowledged within your community\n   -> hard to prove.\n  . could we use google to query for your filetype (can't discriminate between different models)\n  -> has a media type\n  --> This SHOULD be stated as a IANA code [IANA-MT]\n  standardization of at least this listing process is a good measure of 'sharedness'\n  broadly applicable\n  . that the language is extensible to a domain of interest\n  . you can define your own elements in accordance with the semantics of the language\n  \n  gff3 is not in the IANA list -> what steps would the community need to execute to be listed here? cases like GFF, PDB are not broadly applicable \n  biopax -> is defined vnd.biopax.rdf+xml and built on rdf -> allows users to create new elements and relate them \n  jpg -> widely used, registered, but primarily for image content\n  pdf -> registered, enables users to create their own dictionary.\n "^^xsd:string ;
