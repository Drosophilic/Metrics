### Maturity Assessment Identifier: Gen2_FM-I1B [https://purl.org/fair-metrics/Gen2_FM_I1B](https://purl.org/fair-metrics/Gen2_FM_I1B)

### Maturity Assessment Name:   Use a Knowledge Representation Language (strict)

----

### To which principle does it apply?  
I1

### What is being measured?
use of a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.

### Why should we measure it?
The unambiguous communication of knowledge and meaning (what symbols are, and how they relate to one another) necessitates the use of languages that are capable of representing these concepts in a machine-readable manner.

There is debate in the community about what languages would be considered "knowledge representation languages", as such
this Maturity Metric is broken into two sub-metrics (Gen2-FM-I1A and Gen2-FM-I1B).  This metric takes a strict interpretation,
accepting only formats that are ontologically-grounded and machine-resolvable.


### What must be provided for the measurement?
The GUID.


### How is the measurement executed?
The GUID is resolved.  Any Linked Data that can be found is considered a success.


### What is/are considered valid result(s)?
The presence of linked data

### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
