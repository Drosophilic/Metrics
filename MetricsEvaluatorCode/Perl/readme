The subfolder FAIRMetrics contains Perl libraries that make it easier to write metrics tests.

The subfolder Metrics contains perl modules that execute tests.

The script in this folder called "fair_metrics" uses the PATH_INFO on the Web call 
to find the name of the metric that should be tested 
using the BODY of the HTTP call (usually a piece of JSON).  It attempts to autoload that package.
The package should export a function called "execute_metric_test", which does the metric test
on the content of $body (the only value passed to that subroutine), and returns a string of
JSON that contains the result of the test.  TODO:  Content negotiation to get RDF Turtle instead of JSON.


e.g. http://fairdata.systems/cgi-bin/fair_metrics/Metrics/metric_unique_identifier

is the endpoint for the test that the URI scheme is registered somewhere.

so:

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -i -X POST -d '{"subject": "10.5061/dryad.gn219","spec": "https://fairsharing.org/bsg-s001182"}'  http://linkeddata.systems/cgi-bin/fair_metrics/Metrics/metric_unique_identifier_test

will execute the test of whether DOIs are valid identifier schemas (they are... we hope!)
