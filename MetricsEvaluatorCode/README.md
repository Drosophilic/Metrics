# Metrics Compliance Tests and "The Evaluator"

This repository contains the Metrics Compliance tests that were written by the FAIR Metrics team (these are being re-written, so all code in the Perl folder should be considered deprecated and only for historical interest).  

The Evaluator software is avalable in the https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics/edit/master/MetricsEvaluatorCode/Ruby/fairmetrics folder  see the ReadMe in that folder for instructions on use.

**A public demonstration server for The Evaluator** is available at:  http://w3id.org/FAIR_Evaluator  see above for instructions.
