This is the beginning of a set of FAIR Metrics tests.  The script in this folder is called "fair_metrics".  
It uses the PATH_INFO on the Web call to find the name of the metric that should be tested 
using the BODY of the HTTP call (usually a piece of JSON).  It attempts to autoload that package.
The package should export a function called "execute_metric_test", which does the metric test
on the content of $body (the only value passed to that subroutine), and returns a string of
RDF in Turtle format with the results of the test.

So far, we haven't defined how to represent success or failure of a test, so the value is passed
at the end of the predicate "result", as a 1 or a 0... for the moment.

e.g. http://fairdata.systems/cgi-bin/fair_metrics/Metrics/metric_unique_identifier

is the endpoint for the test that the URI scheme is registered somewhere.

so:

echo  '{ "spec" : "http://dx.doi.org" }' | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @-  http://fairdata.systems/cgi-bin/fair_metrics/Metrics/metric_unique_identifier


will execute the test of whether DOIs are valid identifier schemas (they are... we hope!)
