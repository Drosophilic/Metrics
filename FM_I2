		fm:comments """michel: there must be a syntax and associated semantics for that language.  This is sufficient 
  mark: there needs to be some identity or denotation in the language; ('vanilla') xml and json are not FAIR, so should fail this test
  
  *** can you (i) identify elements and (ii) make statements about them, and iii) is there a formally defined interpretation for that   -> HTML fails; PDF fails 
  shared
  -> that there are many users of the language
  . acknowledged within your community
   -> hard to prove.
  . could we use google to query for your filetype (can't discriminate between different models)
  -> has a media type
  --> This SHOULD be stated as a IANA code [IANA-MT]
  standardization of at least this listing process is a good measure of 'sharedness'
  broadly applicable
  . that the language is extensible to a domain of interest
  . you can define your own elements in accordance with the semantics of the language
  
  gff3 is not in the IANA list -> what steps would the community need to execute to be listed here? cases like GFF, PDB are not broadly applicable 
  biopax -> is defined vnd.biopax.rdf+xml and built on rdf -> allows users to create new elements and relate them 
  jpg -> widely used, registered, but primarily for image content
  pdf -> registered, enables users to create their own dictionary.

For interoperability, it must be possible to identify data that can be integrated like-with-like.
